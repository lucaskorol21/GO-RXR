About GO-RXR

GO-RXR (Global Optimization of Resonant X-ray Reflectometry) is an advanced Python-based software designed to streamline the analysis of resonant x-ray reflectometry (RXR) data. RXR is a sophisticated synchrotron technique used to probe the depth-dependent structure of quantum materials, providing insights into the crystal, electronic, and magnetic structures of thin films and heterostructures. The main challenge in RXR lies in the complexity of data analysis, which requires fitting numerous independent variables and constructing intricate models, making it a highly labor-intensive process.

GO-RXR addresses these challenges by integrating state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms with a user-friendly graphical interface developed in Python and PyQt5. The software simplifies the data analysis process, reducing the expertise barrier and enhancing visualization capabilities for material scientists.

Key Features
Advanced Optimization Techniques: Incorporates algorithms like Differential Evolution, Simplicial Homology Global Optimization (SHGO), and Dual Annealing to handle the high-dimensionality and complexity of RXR datasets.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed using PyQt5, the GUI provides intuitive access to all features, including parameter selection, data fitting, and visualization.
Customization Options: Allows users to apply boundary and weight functions selectively, enhancing the precision of optimization results.
Total Variation Penalty Term: This feature ensures that the optimization captures both fine details and broader trends in the data, resulting in more accurate models.
Comprehensive Documentation: The project includes a detailed user manual and tutorials to help users get started quickly.
