Data Analysis Tips

Dummy Variables
    - The dummy variables have a molar density of 0 AMU and a scattering factor of zero for all energies
    - The dummy variables include A, D, E, G, J, L, M, Q, R, T, X, and Z
    - Each layer must be defined with the same number of elements because of the linked roughness implementation
        - Dummy variables are typically used to ensure that the correct number of 'elements' are defined
    - Elements can also be repeated in a chemical formula and used as a dummy variable, but not recommended.

Continuous Model
    - Define substrate: create element variations if necessary (e.g.oxidation states)
    - Define film: create element variations if necessary (e.g.oxidation states)
    - Define additional layer at film/substrate interface to model site termination
    - Define additional layer at surface of film to model site terminations
    - Define impurity layer at the surface
        - If there are more than 2 elements in each layer it is recommended to use define carbons
        - For example, for a system defined with three elements in each layer than the impurity layer can be defined as
            -> CCO
            -> XCO (dummy variable)

Unit Cell Model
- Define the substrate with the generic formula with the materials in the thin-films (e.g. ABO3)
    - Set the roughness (and linked roughness) to zero for all layers
    - Set the thickness to the in-plane lattice constant
    - Define the element variations and their atomic form factors
        - Using the LaMnO3/SrTiO3 example
            A -> Sr and La
            B -> Ti, Mn2+, and Mn3+
            O -> O
    - Include the film layers
    - Include additional layers to model the intermixing at the various interfaces

Theta/Two-Theta Reflectivity Scans
    - The number of oscillations in the Kiessig fringes are related to the thickness of the film
        - Large number of oscillations indicate a thick film
        - Small number of oscillations indiate a thin film
        - Non-resonant energies are used to determine the total film thickness (plus impurity layer)
        - Resonant energies are used to determine the element-specific thickness
    - The roughness dictates the decay at larger momentum values (grazing angles)
        - A larger roughness will result in a larger decay
        - A smaller roughness will result in less decay
    - Always check resonant energy scans to make sure resonance peaks are properly aligned
        - Apply energy shifts to the form factors if the energy peaks of the simulations do not align with the experimental data
    - Theta/Two-Theta reflectivity scans are recommended when fitting the crystal structure of the material

Energy Scans
    - The energy scans for the most part are used to apply energy shifts to the atomic form factors
    - The energy scans are also used to fit the orbital energies
    - It is recommended to use the energy scans when refining the electronic structure (e.g.fitting oxidation states)

Asymmetry Curves
    - The linear asymmetry curves are useful when fitting the orbital energies
    - The circular asymmetry curves are useful when fitting the magnetic structure
    - It is recommended to use the asymmetry curves rather than the asymmetry spectra when fitting the magnetic structure


Asymmetry Spectrum
    - The asymmetry spectra are useful to confirm the magnetic structure

Adaptive Layer Segmentation (ALS)
- A precision value of 1e-6 is recommended for Theta/Two-Theta reflectivity scans (asymmetry curves)
- A precision value of 1e-8 is recommended for the energy scans (asymmetry spectra)

Boundaries and Weights
    - Apply boundaries to remove low-quality portion of the dataset from the data fitting
    - Apply weights to intervals of the dataset to emphasize important features
        - This is recommended when the global optimization algorithm is unable to capture important features of the data

Data Smoothing
    - It is recommended to use the spline interpolation data smoothing


Data fitting
    - The recommended global optimization algorithm is the differential evolution algorithm

Total Variation
    - The total variation measure the agreement in the shape
    - A weight of 100-1000 is recommended for this feature
